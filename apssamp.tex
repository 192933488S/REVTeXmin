% \[ XXX \] %unnumbered single-line eq

Below we have numbered single-line equations; this is the most common
type of equation in \textit{Physical Review}:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1}
\bm{B} = 0\\
\mathfrak{B} = 0\\
\mathbb{B} = 0
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Subsection}

Multiline equations are obtained.


Enclosing display math within
\verb+\begin{subequations}+ and \verb+\end{subequations}+ will produce
a set of equations that are labeled with letters, as shown in
Eqs.~(\ref{subeq:1}) and (\ref{subeq:2}) below.
You may include any number of single-line and multiline equations,
although it is probably not a good idea to follow one display math
directly after another.
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:whole}
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1).\label{subeq:2}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}
\right\},\label{subeq:1}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Giving a \verb+\label{#1}+ command directly after the \verb+\begin{subequations}+, 
allows you to reference all the equations in the \texttt{subequations} environment. 
For example, the equations in the preceding subequations environment were
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:whole}).

\subsubsection{Wide equations}

The equation:

\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
{\cal R}^{(\text{d})}=
 g_{\sigma_2}^e
 \left(
   \frac{[\Gamma^Z(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
  +\frac{[\Gamma^Z(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
 \right)
 + x_WQ_e
 \left(
   \frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
  +\frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
 \right)\;. 
 \label{eq:wideeq}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
This is typed to show how the output appears in wide format.
